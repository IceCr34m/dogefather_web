Pinging Google via manage.py¶
django-admin ping_google [sitemap_url]¶
Once the sitemaps application is added to your project, you may also ping Google using the ping_google management command:

python manage.py ping_google [/sitemap.xml]
--sitemap-uses-http¶
Use this option if your sitemap uses http rather than https.
